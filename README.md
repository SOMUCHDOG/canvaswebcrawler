# canvaswebcrawler


This project was created to help my sister archive her coding boot camp for reference later.

It used the python package selenium web driver to navigate the browser, download the webpage content, download the video content, and sort it into course folders nice and neat!

This code is example code and required information was removed in order to share publically.
